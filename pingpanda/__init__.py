PingPanda - a friendly command line website health checker.

PingPanda started its life as "Status Checker", written by BLACK-SCORP10
(https://github.com/BLACK-SCORP10/url-status-checker) and later enhanced by
matteocapricci.  The original project, its ideas and its output format are
kept intact here; the tool is maintained during the FOSSSoC-S1 season.

The package is split into small modules, every module has one job:

* ``pingpanda.constants`` - the texts and the colours that are printed
* ``pingpanda.models``    - the data that is kept about a checked URL
* ``pingpanda.network``   - resolving a host and checking a URL
* ``pingpanda.report``    - turning the results into the report
* ``pingpanda.cli``       - the arguments and what the tool does with them
